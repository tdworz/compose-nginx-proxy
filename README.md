This project is a [compose spec](https://compose-spec.io/) setup for
[nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy).


Example `.env`

Most configuration may be done by including a `.env` file in the same directory
as the `compose.yml` file. The following is an example of the contents of a
`.env` file.
